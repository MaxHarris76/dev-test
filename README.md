This Program reads in lines from a file and counts the occurences of particular words

The Program itself has already been implemented to read in lines from a txt file, however the CountOccurrences method has not yet been implemented. 
In order to complete this test the CountOccurrences must me implemented that when all lines are read the occurence of each pre-defined word is counted. 

Particular attention should be paid to the time it takes to count the occurences of each word along with memory performance of your implementation.

Following that any choices you make around speed and performance should be noted and justified as to why it was done.

There are a few files of different lengths to allow comparison for time and memory allocation

Please fork this repo and host your solution in your own github
